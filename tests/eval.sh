# Structural eval for council-review.
#
# council-review is a compound, prompt-only skill. Its runtime output is
# non-deterministic (LLM synthesis). This eval locks in the design contract:
# SKILL.md must still name every advisor, every mode, and every execution step
# its README and CLAUDE.md claim. If any drifts, the skill's advertised
# behavior no longer matches its implementation.
#
# Full behavioral evaluation (does the chairman override the majority when
# appropriate?) requires LLM-as-judge against a recorded golden council run
# — deferred to a future pass with real baseline data.
#
# Usage: bash tests/eval.sh
# Exit 0 on pass, 1 on any assertion failure.
